# PRODIGY_DS_02
TASK 2 (PRODIGY INFOTECH)
This task involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and building machine learning models to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using two datasets (train.csv and test.csv). The analysis includes handling missing values, identifying relationships between variables, and visualizing patterns and trends. The final models are evaluated based on their accuracy.
Steps Involved
1. Loading Data: Import the training and test datasets.
2. Handling Missing Values: Fill missing values for numeric columns with the mean and for non-numeric columns with the mode.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze and visualize the distribution of variables.
Identify relationships between features such as gender, age, class, and survival rate.
Plot histograms, bar charts, and pie charts for better insights.
4. Feature Engineering: Convert categorical features into numeric using one-hot encoding.
Model Building and Evaluation:
Train various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy.
Select the best model based on performance.
